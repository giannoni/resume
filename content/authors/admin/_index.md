I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Political Science department at [MIT](https://web.mit.edu). I work on the fields of political economy and quantitative methodology, with a regional focus on Southern Europe and South America and a substantive focus on the interaction between business and politics, labor markets, and anti-system political behavior.

I study the role that firm strategies and workplace interactions have in shaping political behavior and local politics. In my work I use massive administrative datasets and survey experiments to elucidate the role of firms in politics. In my dissertation project I explore the effect that “low-road” employment strategies in Italy and Brazil had in producing political de-attachment and anti-system beliefs, and in feeding local coalitions between business owners and workers that sustain right-wing populist parties. In other projects I explore the distributive coalitions that sustain informality and labor market segmentation in urban contexts, the effects of market power and competition policies on inequality, and the politics of urban land access.
